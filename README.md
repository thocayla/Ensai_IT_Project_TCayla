# IT Tools for Big Data - Project

Objective: Set up a featured data platform for processing pricing data on Hadoop.
For this project, I used the Hadoop Sandbox from Hortonworks.
The data have been retrieved from here : https://www.prix-carburants.gouv.fr/rubrique/opendata/

First, open your VM and start your HortonWorks Sandbox. Then from your browser, go to http://localhost:8080. Both Username and Password are maria_dev.
You can select the HDFS Files view from the menu at the top, navigate to /tmp, create an project folder. Now click on upload and browse the prix2016.csv, prix2015.csv, prix2014.csv and prix2013.csv.

Letâ€™s open the Hive View by clicking on the Hive button from the views menu. Create the tables prix_2016, prix_2015, prix_2014 and prix_2013.
